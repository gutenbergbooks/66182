<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>BACON'S ESSAYS, BY MARKBY.</h3>

<p>Mr. Markby has recently published his promised
edition of Bacon's <i>Essays</i>; and he has in this, as
in his edition of the <i>Advancement of Learning</i>,
successfully traced most of the passages alluded to
by Lord Bacon. The following notes relate to a
few points which still deserve attention:</p>

<p class="essay">Essay I. On Truth:&mdash;"The poet that beautified
the sect that was otherwise inferior to the
rest."] By "beautified" is here meant "set off to
advantage," "embellished."</p>

<p class="essay">Essay II. On Death.&mdash;</p>

<p>Many of the thoughts in the <i>Essays</i> recur in
the "Exempla Antithetorum," in the 6th book
<i>De Augmentis Scientiarum</i>. With respect to this
Essay, compare the article "Vita," No. 12., in
vol. viii. p. 360. ed. Montagu.</p>

<p>"You shall read in some of the friars' books
of mortification, that a man should think with
himself what the pain is, if he have but his finger's
end pressed or tortured, and thereby imagine what
the pains of death are when the whole body is corrupted
and dissolved."] Query, What books are
here alluded to?</p>

<p>"Pompa mortis magis terret, quam mors ipsa."]
Mr. Markby thinks these words are an allusion
to Sen. <i>Ep.</i> xxiv. § 13. Something similar also
occurs in <i>Ep.</i> xiv. § 3. Compare Ovid, <i>Heroid.</i>
x. 82.: "Morsque minus pœnæ quam mora mortis
habet."</p>

<p>"Galba, with a sentence, 'Feri si ex re sit populi
Romani.'"] In addition to the passage of Tacitus,
quoted by Mr. Markby, see Sueton. <i>Galb.</i> c. 20.</p>

<p>"Septimus Severus in despatch, 'Adeste si quid
mihi restat agendum.'"] No such dying words are
attributed to Severus, either in Dio Cassius,
lxxvi. 15., the passage cited by Mr. Markby, or
in Spartian. <i>Sever.</i> c. 23.</p>

<p>In the passage of Juvenal, the words are, "qui
spatium vitæ," and not "qui finem vitæ," as quoted
by Lord Bacon. Length of life is meant.</p>

<p class="essay">Essay III. Of Unity in Religion.&mdash;</p>

<p>"Certain Laodiceans and lukewarm persons."]
The allusion is to Rev. iii. 14-16.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>{142}</span></p>

<p>"It is noted by one of the Fathers, Christ's coat
indeed had no seam, but the Church's vesture was
of divers colours; whereupon he saith, 'in veste
varietas sit, scissura non sit.'"] Query, Who is
the Father alluded to?</p>

<p>"The massacre in France."] <i>I. e.</i> the massacre of
St. Bartholomew.</p>

<p class="essay">Essay IV. Of Revenge.&mdash;See <i>Antitheta</i>, No. 39.
vol. viii. p. 374.</p>

<p>The saying of Cosmo, Duke of Florence, as to
not forgiving friends, recurs in the <i>Apophthegms</i>,
vol. i. p. 394. ed. Montagu.</p>

<p class="essay">Essay V. Of Adversity.&mdash;</p>

<p>On the fable of Hercules sailing over the ocean
in an earthen pot, see <i>Sap. Vet.</i>, vol. x. p. 335.
And concerning the Greek fable, see Schneidewin,
<i>Del. Poes.</i> Gr., p. 329.</p>

<p class="essay">Essay VI. Of Simulation and Dissimulation.&mdash;See
<i>Antitheta</i>, No. 32. vol. viii. p. 370.</p>

<p>"Arts of state and arts of life, as Tacitus well
calleth them."] Mr. Markby does not trace this
allusion, which is not obvious.</p>

<p class="essay">Essay VII. Of Parents and Children.&mdash;See <i>Antitheta</i>,
No. 5. vol. viii. p. 356.</p>

<p>"The Italians make little difference between
children and nephews, or near kinsfolk."] Query,
What ground is there for this assertion?</p>

<p>"Generally the precept is good: 'Optimum elige,
suave et facile illud faciet consuetudo.'"] Query,
Who is the author of this precept?</p>

<p class="essay">Essay VIII. Of Marriage and Single Life.&mdash;See
<i>Antitheta</i>, No. 5. vol. viii. p. 356.</p>

<p>The answer of Thales concerning marriage is
also given in Plut. <i>Symp.</i> iii. 3.</p>

<p class="essay">Essay IX. Of Envy.&mdash;See <i>Antitheta</i>, No. 16.
vol. viii. p. 362.</p>

<p>"The Scripture calleth envy an evil eye."] Lord
Bacon appears to allude to James iv. 5.: "Do ye
think that the Scripture saith in vain, the Spirit
that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?"</p>

<p>"Non est curiosus, quin idem sit malevolus."]
From Plautus, <i>Stich.</i> 1. 3. v. 55. "Nam curiosus
nemo est, quin sit malevolus."</p>

<p>"Therefore it was well said, 'Invidia festos dies
non agit.'"] Whence is this saying taken? It
occurs likewise in the <i>Antitheta</i>.</p>

<p class="essay">Essay X. Of Love.&mdash;See <i>Antitheta</i>, No. 36.
vol. viii. p. 373.</p>

<p>"It hath been well said, that the arch-flatterer,
with whom all the petty flatterers have intelligence,
is a man's self."] Query, From whom is
this saying quoted?</p>

<p>"It was well said, that it is impossible to love
and to be wise."] Mr. Markby cites a verse of
Publius Syrus, "Amare et sapere vix Deo conceditur."
Compare Menander, <i>Andria</i>, Fragm. 1.,
and Ovid, <i>Met.</i> ii. 846.: "Non bene conveniunt,
nec in unâ sede morantur, Majestas et amor."</p>

<p>"I know not how, but martial men are given to
love."] Aristotle (<i>Pol.</i> ii. 9.) has the same remark,
adding that there was good reason for the fable
which made Venus the spouse of Mars.</p>

<p class="essay">Essay XI. Of Great Place.&mdash;See <i>Antitheta</i>,
No. 7. vol. viii. p. 357.</p>

<p>"Cum non sis qui fueris, non esse cur velis
vivere."] Whatever may be the source of this
quotation, the sense seems to require <i>est</i> for <i>esse</i>.</p>

<p>"It is most true that was anciently spoken: 'A
place showeth the man.'"] The allusion is to the
celebrated Greek proverb "ἀρχὴ ἄνδρα δείκνυσι," attributed
to Bias, Solon, Pittacus, and others. See
Diogenianus, <i>Prov.</i> ii. 94., with the note of Leutsch
and Schneidewin.</p>

<p class="essay">Essay XII. Of Boldness.&mdash;See <i>Antitheta</i>, No. 33.
vol. viii. p. 371.</p>

<p>"Question was asked of Demosthenes," &amp;c.]
See <i>Cic. de Orat.</i> iii. 56.; <i>Brut.</i> 38.; <i>Plut. Vit.
X. Orat.</i> c. 8. By the Greek word ὑπόκρισις, and
the Latin word <i>actio</i>, in this anecdote, is meant all
that belongs to the <i>acting</i> or <i>delivery</i> of a speech.
Bacon appears, by his following remarks, not to
include elocution in <i>actio</i>; which was certainly not
Cicero's understanding of the word.</p>

<p>"If the hill will not come to Mahomet, Mahomet
will go to the hill."] Query, What is the
authority for this well-known story?</p>

<p class="essay">Essay XIII. Of Goodness.&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Turks, a cruel people, nevertheless are
kind to beasts, and give alms to dogs and birds;
insomuch, as Busbechius reporteth, a Christian
boy in Constantinople had like to have been stoned
for gagging in a waggishness a long-billed fowl."]
A. G. Busbequius, <i>Legationis Turcicæ Epistolæ
quattuor</i>, in Epist. iii. p. 107. of his works, Lond.
1660, tells a story of a Venetian goldsmith at
Constantinople, who was fond of fowling, and had
caught a bird of the size of the cuckoo, and of the
same colour; with a beak not very large, but with
jaws so wide that, when opened, they would admit
a man's fist. This bird he fastened over his door,
with extended wings, and a stick in his beak, so
as to extend the jaws to a great width, as a joke.
The Turks, who were passing by, took compassion
on the bird; seized the goldsmith by the neck, and
led him before the criminal judge. He was with
difficulty saved from an infliction of the bastinado
by the interference of the Venetian Bailo. The
man told the story to Busbequius, and showed
him the bird; who supposed it to be the <i>Caprimulgus</i>,
or goat-sucker. A full account of the
<i>Caprimulgus Europæus</i> (the bird here alluded to)
may be seen in the <i>Penny Cyclopædia</i>, art. <span class="sc">Nightjars</span>.
It will be observed that Bacon quotes the
story from memory, and does not represent the
particulars of it with accuracy. It is not a Christian
<i>boy</i>, nor is he threatened with <i>stoning</i>, nor is
the bird a <i>long-billed</i> fowl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>{143}</span></p>

<p>"Neither give thou Æsop's cock a gem," &amp;c.]
Compare <i>Apophthegms</i>, No. 203. p. 393.</p>

<p>"Such men in other men's calamities are, as it
were, in season, <i>and are ever on the loading part</i>."]
By "the loading part," seems to be meant the part
which is most heavily laden; the part which supports
the chief burthen.</p>

<p>"Misanthropi, that make it their practice to
bring men to the bough, and yet have never a tree
for the purpose in their gardens as Timon had."]
Query, What is the allusion in this passage?
Nothing of the sort occurs in Lucian's dialogue of
Timon.</p>

<p class="essay">Essay XIV. Of Nobility.&mdash;See <i>Antitheta</i>, No. 1.
vol. viii. p. 354.</p>

<p class="essay">Essay XV. Of Seditions and Troubles.&mdash;</p>

<p>"As Machiavel noteth well, when princes, that
ought to be common parents, make themselves as
a party," &amp;c.] Perhaps Lord Bacon alludes to
<i>Disc.</i> iii. 27.</p>

<p>"As Tacitus expresseth it well, 'Liberius quam
ut imperantium meminissent.'"] Mr. Markby is
at a loss to trace this quotation. I am unable to
assist him.</p>

<p>The verses of Lucan are quoted from memory.
The original has, "Avidumque in tempora," and
"Et concussa fides."</p>

<p>"Dolendi modus, timendi non item."] Query,
Whence are these words taken?</p>

<p>"Solvam cingula regum."] Mr. Markby refers
to Job xii. 18.; but the passage alluded to seems
to be Isaiah xlv. 1.</p>

<p>The story of Epimetheus is differently applied
in <i>Sap. Vet.</i>, vol. x. p. 342.</p>

<p>The saying of Cæsar on Sylla is inserted in the
<i>Apophthegms</i>, No. 135. p. 379. That of Galba is
likewise to be found in Suet. <i>Galb.</i> 16.</p>

<p class="essay">Essay XVI. Of Atheism.&mdash;See <i>Antitheta</i>, No. 13.
vol. viii. p. 360.</p>

<p>"Who to him is instead of a god, or melior
natura."] From Ovid, <i>Met.</i> 1. 21. "Hanc deus
et melior litem natura diremit."</p>

<p class="essay">Essay XVII. Of Superstition.&mdash;See <i>Antitheta</i>,
No. 13. vol. viii. p. 360.</p>

<p class="essay">Essay XIX. Of Empire.&mdash;See <i>Antitheta</i>, No. 8.
vol. viii. p. 358.</p>

<p>"And the like was done by that league, which

<h3>THE ISTHMUS OF PANAMA.</h3>

<p>The interest which the execution of the railroad
across the Isthmus of Panama excites, induces me
to transmit you the following extract from Gage's
<i>New Survey of the West Indies</i>, 8vo., London, 1699.</p>

<p>A few lines relative to the author, of whom but
little is known, may be also of use. He was the
son of John Gage, of Haling; and his brother was
Sir Henry Gage, governor of Oxford, killed at the
battle at Culham Bridge, Jan. 11, 1644. His
family were of the Roman Catholic faith; and he
was sent by his father in 1612 into Spain, to study
under the Jesuits, in the hope he would join that
society; but his aversion to them led him to enter
the Dominican Order at Valladolid, in 1612. His
motives were suspected; his father was irritated&mdash;threatened
to disinherit him and to arouse against
him the power of the Jesuits of England if he returned
home. He now determined to pass over to
the Spanish possessions in South America; but as an
order had been issued by the king, forbidding this
to any <i>Englishman</i>, it was only by inclosing him
in an empty sea-biscuit case, he was able to sail
from Cadiz, July 2, 1625. He arrived at Mexico
on October 8; and after residing there for some
time to recruit himself from the voyage, resolved
to abandon a missionary scheme to the Philippine
islands he had planned, and accordingly, on the
day fixed for their departure to Acapulco, escaped
with three other Dominicans for Chispat. He
was here well received, and went subsequently to
the head establishment at Guatimala. He was
soon appointed curate of Amatitlan; and during
his residence at this and another district contrived
to amass a sum of 9000 piastres, with the aid of
which he sought to accomplish his long-cherished
desire of returning to England. Many difficulties
were in his way; but on the 7th January, 1637,
he quitted Amatitlan, traversed the province of
Nicaragua, and embarked from the coast of Costa
Rica. The ship was soon after boarded by a
Dutch corsair, and Gage was robbed of 8000
piastres. He succeeded in reaching Panama,
traversed the Isthmus, and sailed from Porto Bello<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>{145}</span>
in the Spanish fleet, which reached San Sucar,
Nov. 28, 1637. He returned to England after
an absence of twenty-four years. His father was
dead: he found himself disinherited, and although
hardly recognised by his family at first, he met
ultimately with kindly treatment. During his
residence in S. America, doubts had arisen in his
mind as to the truth and validity of the creed
and ritual to which he was attached. Whether
this was the consequence of reflection from his
theological studies, or animated love of change
which his conduct at times betrayed, cannot be
decided. He resolved to proceed to Italy, and
renew his studies there. Upon his return, after a
short residence, he renounced Catholicism in a
sermon he preached at St. Paul's. About 1642
he attached himself to the Parliament cause, and
it is said he obtained the living of Deal in Kent;
as the parish registers contain an entry of the
burial of Mary daughter, and Mary wife, of
Thomas Gage, parson of Deal, March 21, 1652;
but when he was married, and whom he married,
does not appear. Gage's work has been rather
too much decried. It contains matter of interest
relative to the state of the Spanish possessions; and
his credulity and superstition must be considered
in relation to his opportunities and his age.
Perhaps some of your readers may contribute
farther information concerning him, as the general
accounts I have been able to meet with are contradictory
and insufficient. The <i>Biographie Universelle</i>
states, that it was his <i>Survey of the West
Indies</i> that led to the English expeditions to the
Spanish Main, which secured Jamaica to the English
in 1654, and adds he died there in 1655.
The registers at Deal could probably prove this
fact; but I confess to doubt as to whether Gage
really were the parson alluded to as resident there
in 1652. He was evidently of a roving unsteady
nature, fond of adventure, and the first to open to
English enterprise a knowledge of the state of the
Spanish possessions, to prevent which the council
of the Indies had passed so many stringent laws.
Colbert caused this work to be translated, and it
has been often reprinted on the Continent, but
much mutilated, as his statements relative to the
Roman Catholic priesthood gave offence. A good
memoir of Gage is still to be desired. The following
is the extract relative to the Isthmus of Panama,
<i>West Indies</i>, p. 151.:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Peruvian part containeth all the southern
tract, and is tyed to the Mexican by the Isthmus or
Strait of Darien, being no more than 17, or, as others
say, in the narrowest place, but 12 miles broad, from
the north to the south sea. Many have mentioned to
the Council of Spain the cutting of a navigable channel
through this small Isthmus, so to shorten the voyage
to China and the Moluccoes. But the kings of Spain
have not yet attempted to do it; some say lest in the
work he should lose those few Indians which are left
(would to God it were so, that they were or had been
so careful and tender of the poor Indians' lives, more
populous would that vast and spacious country be at
this day), but others say he hath not attempted it lest
the passage by the Cape Bona Esperanza (Good
Hope) being left off, those seas might become a receptacle
for pirates. However, this hath not been
attempted by the Spaniards; they give not for reason
any extraordinary great charge, for that would soon be
recompensed with the speedie and easie conveying that
way the commodities from S. to N. seas."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This bears reference to projects before 1625,
or during his residence in S. America, between
1625-1637; but Gage could hardly have understood
the nature of the Spanish character, and the
genius of the government, to speculate upon the
cause of their neglect of every useful enterprise
for the promotion of commerce and public good.</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>

<p><i>Legends of the County Clare.</i>&mdash;On the west
coast of Ireland, near the Cliffs of Moher, at some
distance out in the bay, the waves appear continually
breaking in white foam even on the
calmest day. The tradition among the country
people is, that a great city was swallowed up there
for some great crime, and that it becomes visible
once every seven years. And if the person who
sees it could keep his eyes fixed on it till he
reached it, it would then be restored, and he
would obtain great wealth. The man who related
the legend stated farther, that some years ago
some labourers were at work in a field on the hill
side in view of the bay; and one of them, happening
to cast his eyes seaward, saw the city in all
its splendour emerge from the deep. He called
to his companions to look at it; but though they
were close to him, he could not attract their attention:
at last, he turned round to see why they
would not come; but on looking back, when he
had succeeded in attracting their attention, the
city had disappeared.</p>

<p>The Welsh legend of the Islands of the Blessed,
which can only be seen by a person who stands
on a turf from St. David's churchyard, bears a
curious coincidence to the above. It is not impossible
that there may have been some foundation
for the vision of the enchanted city at Moher
in the <i>Fata Morgana</i>, very beautiful spectacles of
which have been seen on other parts of the coast
of Ireland.</p>

<p><i>Moon Superstitions</i> (Vol. viii., p. 79.).&mdash;In this
age of fact and science, it is remarkable that even
with the well-informed the old faith in the "change
of the moon" as a prognostic of fair and foul weather
still keeps its hold. W. W. asks "have we
any proof of" the "correctness" of this faith? To
suppose that the weather varies with the amount of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>{146}</span>
illuminated surface on the moon would make the
change in the weather vary with the amount of
moonshine, which of course is absurd, as in that case
the clouds would have much more to do with the
question than the moon's shadow. But still it may
be said the moon may influence the weather as it
is supposed to cause the tides. In answer to this
I beg to state the opinion of Dr. Ick, who was for
upwards of ten years the curator of the Birmingham
Philosophical Institute, an excellent meteorologist,
geologist, and botanist. He assured me
that after the closest and most accurate observation
of the moon and the weather, he had arrived
at the conclusion that <i>there is not the slightest
observable dependence between them</i>.</p>

where a similar practice exists. If a female is
afflicted with fits, nine pieces of silver money and
nine threehalfpences are collected from nine bachelors:
the silver money is converted into a ring
to be worn by the afflicted person, and the threehalfpences
(<i>i. e.</i> 13½<i>d.</i>) are paid to the maker of
the ring, an inadequate remuneration for his labour,
but which he good-naturedly accepts. If
the afflicted person be a male, the contributions
are levied upon females.</p>

that otherwise it must die. Hence the custom, so
universal, of hanging any serpent on a tree after
killing it.</p>

<p><i>A Devonshire Charm for the Thrush.</i>&mdash;On
visiting one of my parishioners, whose infant was
ill with the thrush, I asked her what medicine she
had given the child? She replied, she had done
nothing to it but say the eighth Psalm over it. I
found that her cure was to repeat the eighth Psalm
over the infant three times, three days running; and
on my hesitating a doubt as to the efficacy of the
remedy, she appealed to the case of another of her
children who had suffered badly from the thrush,
but had been cured by the use of no other means.
If it was said "with the virtue," it was, she declared,
an unfailing cure. The mention, in this
Psalm, of "the mouths of babes and sucklings,"
I suppose led to its selection.</p>

<h3>OLD JOKES.</h3>

<p>Every man ought to read the jest-books, that
he may not make himself disagreeable by repeating
"old Joes" as the very last good things.
One book of this class is little more than the
copy of another as to the points, with a change
of the persons; and the same joke, slightly varied,
appears in as many different countries as the same
fairy-tale. Seven years ago I found at Prague
the "Joe" of the Irishman saying that there were
a hundred judges on the bench, because there was
one with two cyphers. The valet-de-place told
me that when the Emperor and Metternich were
together they were called "the council of ten,"
because they were <i>eins und zero</i>.</p>

<p>It is interesting to trace a joke back, of which
process I send an example. In the very clever
version of the Chancellor of Oxford's speech on
introducing the new doctors (<i>Punch</i>, No. 622.)
are these lines:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"En Henleium! en Stanleium! Hic eminens prosator:</p>
    <p>Ille, filius pulchro patre, hercle pulchrior orator;</p>
    <p>Demosthenes in herbâ, <i>sed in ore retinens illos</i></p>
    <p><i>Quos, antequam peroravit, Græcus respuit lapillos.</i>"</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Ebenezer Grubb, in his description of the opposition
in 1814, thus notices Mr. F. Douglas:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He is a forward and frequent speaker; remarkable
for a graceful inclination of the upper part of his body
in advance of the lower, and speaketh, I suspect <i>(after
the manner of an ancient), with pebbles in his mouth</i>."&mdash;<i>New
Whig Guide</i>, 1819, p. 47.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In Foote's <i>Patron</i>, Sir Roger Dowlas, an East
India proprietor, who has sought instruction in
oratory from Sir Thomas Lofty, is introduced to
the <i>conversazione</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<i>Sir Thomas.</i> Sir Roger, be seated. This gentleman
has, in common with the greatest orator the world
ever saw, a small natural infirmity; he stutters a little:
but I have prescribed the same remedy that Demosthenes
used, and don't despair of a radical cure. Well,
sir, have you digested those general rules?</p>

<p><i>Sir Roger.</i> Pr-ett-y well, I am obli-g'd to you,
Sir Th-omas.</p>

<p><i>Sir Thomas.</i> Did you open at the last general
court?</p>

<p><i>Sir Roger.</i> I att-empt-ed fo-ur or five times.</p>

<p><i>Sir Thomas.</i> What hindered your progress?</p>

<p><i>Sir Roger.</i> <i>The pe-b-bles.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>{147}</span></p>

<p><i>Sir Thomas.</i> <i>Oh, the pebbles in his mouth</i>: but they
are only put in to practise in private: <i>you should take
them out when you are addressing the public</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I cannot trace the joke farther, but as Foote,
though so rich in wit, was a great borrower, it
might not be new in 1764.</p>

<h3>AN INTERPOLATION OF THE PLAYERS: TOBACCO.</h3>

<p>I have witnessed the representation of the <i>Twelfth
Night</i> as often, during the last five-and-forty years,
as I have had an opportunity; and, in every instance,
Sir Toby, Sir Andrew, and the Clown, in
their rollicking orgies, <i>smoke tobacco</i>. Now, this
must be an "interpolation of the players;" for not
only was tobacco unknown in Illyria, at the period
of the story, but <i>Shakspeare does not once name tobacco
in his works, and, therefore</i>, was not likely
to give a stage-direction for the use of it. The
great poet is freely blamed for anachronisms; it is
but fair he should have due credit when he avoids
them. The stories of his plays are all antecedent
to his own time, therefore he never mentions
either the <i>drinking of tobacco</i>, or the tumultuous
scenes of the <i>ordinary</i> which belonged to it, and
which are so constantly met with in his cotemporary
dramatists. I see there is a note in my
commonplace-book, after some remarks upon
Green's <i>Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay</i>, "that this
play, though written by a pedant, and a Master of
Arts, contains more anachronisms than any one
play of Shakspeare's."</p>

<p>Can any of your correspondents learned in stage
traditions say when this "smoking interpolation"
was first made?</p>

<hr />

<p>But, Sir, I think I shall surprise some of your
readers by pointing out another instance of the
absence of tobacco or smoking. In the <i>Arabian
Night's Entertainments</i>, which are said to be such
faithful pictures of oriental manners, there is no
mention of the pipe. Neither is coffee to be met
with in those tales, so delightful to all ages. We with
difficulty imagine an oriental without his <i>chibauk</i>;
and yet it is certain they knew nothing of this
luxury before the sixteenth century. At present,
such is the almost imperious necessity felt by the
Turk for smoking and coffee, that as soon as the
gun announces the setting of the sun, during the
fast of the Ramada, before he thinks of satisfying
his craving stomach with any solid food, he takes
his cup of coffee and lights his pipe.&mdash;As I think
it dishonest to deck ourselves with knowledge
that is not self-acquired, I confess to the having
but just read this "note" in the last number of
the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>, in a fine work upon
America by the celebrated savant, M. Ampère.</p>

<h3>Minor Notes.</h3>

<p><i>Curious Epitaph.</i>&mdash;In the <i>Diary of Thomas
Moore</i>, Charles Lamb is said at a certain dinner
party to have "quoted an epitaph by Clio Rickman,
in which, after several lines in the usual jog-trot
style of epitaph, he continued thus:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>'He well perform'd the husband's, father's part,</p>
    <p>And knew immortal Hudibras by heart.'"</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>There is an epitaph in the churchyard of Newhaven,
Sussex, in which the last of these two lines
occurs, but which does not answer in other respects
to the character of the one quoted by Lamb. On
the contrary, it is altogether eminently quaint,
peculiar, and consistent. The stone is to the
memory of Thomas Tipper, who departed this life
May the 14th, 1785, aged fifty-four years; and the
upper part is embellished with a representation,
in bas-relief, of the drawbridge which crosses the
river, whence it might be inferred that the comprehensive
genius of Mr. Tipper included engineering
and architecture. The epitaph runs thus:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"Reader, with kind regard this grave survey,</p>
    <p>Nor heedless pass where Tipper's ashes lay.</p>
    <p>Honest he was, ingenuous, blunt and kind,</p>
    <p>And dared do what few dare do&mdash;speak his mind.</p>
    <p>Philosophy and History well he knew,</p>
    <p>Was versed in Physick and in Surgery too:</p>
    <p>The best old Stingo he both brew'd and sold,</p>
    <p>Nor did one knavish act to get his gold.</p>
    <p>He play'd through life a varied comic part,</p>
    <p>And knew immortal Hudibras by heart.</p>
    <p>Reader, in real truth this was the man:</p>
    <p>Be better, wiser, laugh more if you can."</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Is there any reason for supposing this epitaph
to have been written by Clio Rickman; and is
anything known of Mr. Tipper beyond the biography
of his tombstone?</p>

<p class="author"><span class="sc">G. J. De Wilde.</span></p>

<p><i>Enigmatical Epitaph.</i>&mdash;I offer for solution an
enigma, copied from a tomb in the churchyard of
Christchurch in Hampshire:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"WE WERE NOT SLAYNE BUT RAYSD;<br />
RAYSD NOT TO LIFE,<br />
BVT TO BE BVRIED TWICE<br />
BY MEN OF STRIFE.<br />
WHAT REST COVLD ᵀᴴ LIVING HAVE,<br />
WHEN DEAD HAD NONE?<br />
AGREE AMONGST YOV,<br />
HERE WE TEN ARE ONE.<br />
HEN. ROGERS DIED APRIL 17, 1641.</p>

<p class="i5">I. R."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The popular legend is, that the ten men perished
by the falling in of a gravel-pit, and that their remains
were buried together. This, however, will
not account for the "men of strife."</p>

<p>Is it not probable that, in the time of the civil

<p><i>Books worthy to be reprinted</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 153.
203.).&mdash;In addition to those previously mentioned
in "N. &amp; Q.," there is one for which a crying
necessity exists for a new edition, namely, <i>The
Complaynt of Scotland</i>. It is often advertised
and otherwise sought for; and when found, can
only be had at a most extravagant price. It was
originally written in 1548; and in 1801, a limited
impression, edited by Dr. Leyden, was published;
and in 1829, "Critiques upon it by David Herd,
and others, with observations in answer by Dr.
Leyden," to the number of seventy copies. <i>The
Complaynt of Scotland</i> and <i>Sir Tristrem</i>, an edition
of which was edited by Sir Walter Scott, and
published in 1804, are two of the oldest works of
which the literature of Scotland can boast.</p>

<p><i>Napoleon's Thunderstorm.</i>&mdash;The passage of the
Niemen by the French army, and its consequent
entry on Russian territory, may be said to have
been Napoleon's first step towards defeat and ruin.
A terrible thunderstorm occurred on that occasion,
according to M. Ségur's account of the Russian
campaign.</p>

<p>When Napoleon commenced the retreat, by
which he yielded all the country beyond the Elbe
(and which, therefore, may be reckoned a second
step towards his downfall), it was accompanied by
a thunderstorm more remarkable from occurring
at such a season. Odelben says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"C'était un phenomène bien extraordinaire dans un
pareil saison, et avec le froid qu'on venait d'éprouver,"
&amp;c.&mdash;Odelben, <i>Camp. de 1813</i>, vol. i. p. 289.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The first step towards his second downfall, or
third towards complete ruin, was his advance upon
the British force at Quatre-Bras, June 17, 1815.
This also was accompanied by an awful thunderstorm,
which (although gathering all the forenoon)
commenced at the very moment he made his attack
on the British rear-guard (about two p. m.),
when the first gun fired was instantaneously responded
to by a tremendous peal of thunder.</p>

<p>Thunder, to Wellington, was the precursor of
victory and triumph. Witness the above-mentioned
introduction to the victory of Waterloo;
the terrible thunder, that scattered the horses of
the dragoons, the eve of Salamanca; also, the
night preceding Sabugal. And perhaps some of
the Duke's old companions in arms may be able
to add to the category.</p>

<p><i>Istamboul&mdash;Constantinople.</i>&mdash;Mr. (afterwards
Sir George) Wheler, who took holy orders and
became rector of Houghton-le-Spring in the
diocese of Durham, makes the following remarks
in his <i>Journey into Greece, &amp;c.</i> (fol., Lond. 1682),
p. 178.:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Constantinople is now vulgarly called <i>Stambol</i> by
the Turks; but by the Greeks more often <i>Istampoli</i>,
which must needs be a corruption from the Greek
... either from Constantinopolis, which in process
of time might be corrupted into <i>Stanpolis</i> or <i>Istanpoli</i>;
or rather, from it being called πόλις κατ' ἐξοχήνο.
For the Turks, hearing the Greeks express their going
to Constantinople by εἰς τὴν πόλιν, which they pronounce
Is-tin-polin, and often for brevity's sake Stinpoli, might
soon ignorantly call it <i>Istanpoli</i> or <i>Stambol</i>, according
as either of them came into vogue first. And therefore
I think theirs is a groundless fancy who fetch it
from the Turkish word <i>Istamboal</i>, which signifies a
city full of or abounding in the true faith, the name
being so apparently of Greek original."</p>

<h3>STRUT-STOWERS, AND YEATHERS OR YADDERS.</h3>

<p>In the Collection of divers curious Historical
Pieces printed by the Rev. Francis Peck at the
end of his <i>Memoirs of Oliver Cromwell</i>, is&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Some account of the Murder of the Hermit of
Eskdale-side, near Whitby, in Com. Ebor. by William
de Bruce (Lord of Ugle Barnby), Ralph de Peircy
(Lord of Snealon), and one Allatson, a Gent., and of
the remarkable penance which the Hermit enjoyned
them before he died."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The story is briefly this:&mdash;On the 16th October,
15 Henry II., De Bruce, De Peircy, and
Allatson were hunting the wild boar in Eskdale-side,
where was a chapel and hermitage, in which
lived a monk of Whitby, who was a hermit. The
boar being hotly pursued by the dogs, ran into
the chapel and there laid down and died. The
hermit shut the door on the hounds, who stood at
bay without. The three gentlemen coming up,
flew into a great fury, and ran with their boar-staves
at the hermit and so wounded him that he
ultimately died. The three gentlemen, fearing
his death, took sanctuary at Scarborough, but the
Abbot of Whitby being in great favour with the
king, removed them out of sanctuary, whereby
they became liable to the law. The dying hermit
(he survived till the 8th December), on the
abbot's proposing to put them to death, suggested
the following penance, to which, in order to save
their lives and goods, they consented, and to which
the abbot likewise agreed:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You and yours shall hold your lands of the Abbat
of Whitby and his successors after this manner, viz.
upon the eve [or morrow before] Ascension Day, you,
or some of you, shall come to the wood of Stray-Head,
which is in Eskdale-side, by sun-rising, and there shall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>{149}</span>
the officer of the abbat blow his horn, that ye may
know how to find him. And he shall deliver to you,
William de Bruce, ten stakes, eleven strut-stowers, and
eleven yeathers, to be cut by you, and those that come
for you, with a knife of a penny price. And you
Ralph de Peircy, shall take one and twenty of each
sort, to be cut in the same manner. And you, Allatson,
shall take nine of each sort, to be cut as aforesaid.
And then ye shall take them on your backs, and
carry them to the town of Whitby, and take care to be
there before nine of the clock, and at the same hour, if
it be a full sea, to cease your service. But, if it be low
water at nine of the clock, then each of you shall, the
same hour, set your stakes at the edge of the water,
each stake a yard from the other, and so yeather them
with your yeathers, and stake them on each side with
your strut-stowers, that they may stand three tides,
without removing by the force of the water. And
each of you shall really do, perform, and execute this
service yearly at the hour appointed, except it be a full
sea, when this service shall cease; in remembrance that
ye did most cruelly slay me. And that ye may the
more seriously and fervently call upon God for mercy,
and repent unfeignedly of your sins, and do good
works, the officer of Eskdale-side shall blow, Out on
you! Out on you! Out on you! for this heinous crime
of yours. And if you or yours shall refuse this service
at the aforesaid hour, when it shall not be a full sea,
then you shall forfeit all your lands to the Abbat of
Whitby and his successors."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>There is a similar account, with verbal and
other variations, "From a printed copy published
at Whitby a few years ago," in Blount's <i>Jocular
Tenures</i>, by Beckwith, pp. 557-560. In that account
the word, which in Mr. Peck's account is
"yeathers," is "yadders." Mr. Beckwith states,
"This service is still annually performed."</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott (<i>Marmion</i>, Canto II. st. 13.)
thus alludes to the legend:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"Then Whitby's nuns exulting told,</p>
    <p>How to their house three Barons bold</p>
    <p class="i1">Must menial service do;</p>
    <p>While horns blow out a note of shame,</p>
    <p>And monks cry 'Fye upon your name!</p>
    <p>In wrath, for loss of silvan game,</p>
    <p class="i1">Saint Hilda's priest ye slew.'&mdash;</p>
    <p>'This on Ascension Day, each year,</p>
    <p>While labouring on our harbour pier,</p>
    <p>Must Herbert, Bruce, and Percy hear.'"</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In note 2. C. the popular account printed and
circulated at Whitby is given. It is substantially
the same with that given by Beckwith, but for
"strut-stowers" we have "strout-stowers;" and
for "yadders" we have "yethers." It appears,
also, that the service was not at that time performed
by the proprietors in person; and that
part of the lands charged therewith were then
held by a gentleman of the name of Herbert.</p>

<p>I shall be glad if any of your correspondents
will elucidate the terms strut-stowers, and yeathers
or yadders.</p>

<p><i>Position of Font.</i>&mdash;The usual and very significant
position of the font is near the church door.
But there is one objection to this, viz. that the
benches being best arranged facing the chancel,
the people cannot without much confusion see the
baptisms. This being so, perhaps a better place<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>{150}</span>
for the font is at the entrance of the chancel. The
holy rite, so edifying to the congregation, as well
as profitable to the recipient, can then be duly
seen; and the position is tolerably symbolical,
expressing as it were "the way that is opened for
us into the holiest of all." I am curious to know
if there are any ancient examples of this position,
and how far the canon sanctions it, which directs
that the font be set up in "the ancient usual
<i>places</i>" [plural]? While on the subject let me
put another Query. The Rubric directs that the
font be "then," <i>i. e.</i> just before the baptism,
filled with pure water. In what vessel is the
water brought, and who fills the font? What
are the precedents in this matter? Rules, I
think, there are none.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"L'impératrice des Russies a fait enlever tout le

distingué, qui avait une très-belle collection en ce
genre. M. de Marigny a eu la douleur de voir passer
ces richesses chez l'étranger, faute de fonds pour les
acquérir pour le compte du roi.</p>

<p>"On distinguait parmi ces tableaux un portrait en
pied de Charles I., roi d'Angleterre, original de Vandyk.
C'est le seul qui soit resté en France. Madame
la Comtesse Dubarri, qui déploie de plus en plus son
goût pour les arts, a ordonné de l'acheter: elle l'a payé
24,000 livres. Et sur le reproche qu'on lui faisait de
choisir un pareil morceau entre tant d'autres qui auraient
dû lui mieux convenir, elle a répondu que c'était un
portrait de famille qu'elle retirait. En effet, les Dubarri
se prétendent parents de la Maison des Stuards."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In order to afford somewhat of a clue to this
discovery, I send a few extracts from another
anonymous work: <i>A Letter to the late Author of
the</i> "<i>Preparation for Martyrdom</i>," alluding to various
circumstances relating to the author:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I must confess that I had once as great a veneration
for you as for any one [of] your figure in the
church; but then you preach'd honestly, and liv'd
peaceably; but since pride or ambitious discontent,
or some particular respects to some special friends of
the adverse party, or something I know not what else,
has thrust you upon scribbling, and a design of being
popular; since you had forsaken your first love (if
ever you had any) to our church and establishment,
and appear to be running over <i>ad partem Donati</i>, to
the disturbers of our church and peace, you must needs
pardon this short reflection, though from an old friend,
and sometimes a great admirer of you.</p>

<p>"As for the present establishment, you have (you
conclude) as much already from that as you are likely
to have, but you claw the democratical party, hoping
at long run to see an (<i>English</i>) Parliament; that is,
we must know, one that has no <i>French</i> pensioners
shuffled into it to blast the whole business, such as will
be govern'd by your instructions; and then Presbytery
(you trust) will be turn'd up Trump, the Directory
once more take place of the Liturgy, and God knows
what become of the Monarchy, and Mr. C. be made a
great man.</p>

<p>"What an excellent design was that of your Stipulation,
which I heard one say was like a new modell'd
Independency. 'Twas intended, I suppose, as an expedient
to reduce the sheep of your own flock, which
through your default chiefly (as is commonly reported)
were gone astray; but because this tool could not
work, without the force of a law to move it, therefore
by law it must have been establisht, and the whole

have set their instruments to your key, and their voices
to the tune of <i>B&mdash;ley</i>. Oh! had this engine but met
with firm footings in Parliament, as was hoped, our

this day; it had gone round, and in the church all old
things had been done away, and everything had appeared
new. But, Sir, I trust the foundations of our

your <i>Catholicon</i> (as you vainly call it) to support 'em.</p>

'Twere no living for <i>Simon Magus</i>, or any
of his disciples here, if those rules you there lay down

only; but in this of <i>Martyrdom</i> not a little
impious, in your unworthy reflections upon almost all
the honest people of England since the beginning of
the reign of <i>Oliver</i> the First, and some time before;
not sparing many loyal worthies' memory who held up
a good cause upon their sword points (as you express
it) as long as they could; and when they could do so
no longer, either dy'd for't, or deliver'd themselves up
to the will of the conqueror, yet never (as you) abjur'd
the cause. Our rulers you suppose are ill affected
(otherwise your talk of Popery at your rate is like
that of one that were desirous and in conspiracy to
bring in Popery): and, undoubtedly, it had been in
already, had not the prayers of Mr. C., and the fifty
righteous <i>Non-Cons</i> in every city, prevented it."</p>

<h3>THE DRUMMER'S LETTER.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. vii., p. 431.)</p>

<p>Mr. Forbes rightly describes the Drummer's
Letter in the <i>Sentimental Journey</i> as "not only correctly
but elegantly written." There is, moreover,
in two or three places, a play upon words,
which indicates an intimate acquaintance with the
idiomatic turns of the language. But all these
circumstances are, to my mind, only so many
grounds for the belief that the French of the
letter is not Sterne's.</p>

<p>If we are to judge of Sterne's French from the
samples to be met with in <i>Tristram Shandy</i> and
the <i>Sentimental Journal</i>, there is ample evidence
that his knowledge of that language was somewhat
superficial. I shall give a few examples.</p>

<p>Your readers are familiar with the incident in
<i>Tristram Shandy</i>, where the Abbess and Margarita,
having occasion to make use of two very
coarse and indecent expressions, resort to the
ludicrous expedient of splitting them in two, each
pronouncing a separate syllable. Those words
are scandalously common in the mouths of Frenchmen;
and yet Sterne seems so little aware of the
correct spelling of them, that he makes the poor
nuns give utterance to two words, one of which,
"bouger," means "to move," and the other,
"fouter," is unknown to the French language.</p>

<p>Farther on, in chapter xxxiv., the commissary
employs the expression "C'est tout égal;" but
this is merely the translation of our English
phrase "'Tis all one." The French say "C'est
égal," but never "C'est tout égal."</p>

<p>In the <i>Sentimental Journey</i>, under the head of
"The Bidet," La Fleur is made to say "C'est <i>un</i>
cheval le plus opiniâtre du monde." Now, the
man who could write the Drummer's Letter
would not have applied the epithet "opiniâtre"<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>{154}</span>
to a horse; and, at any rate, he would have said
"C'est <i>le</i> cheval le plus opiniâtre du monde."</p>

<p>In the chapter headed "The Passport," and
also in another place, we have the phrase "Ces
Messieurs Anglais sont des gens très extraordinaires."
This should be "Messieurs les Anglais,"
&amp;c.</p>

<p>Again, under the head of "Characters," Count
de B. says, "But if you do support it, <i>M. Anglais</i>,
you must do it with all your powers." This "M.
Anglais" is our "Mr. Englishman." The correct
expression is "M. l'Anglais"&mdash;Mr. <i>the</i> Englishman.</p>

<p>I might add other instances; but these, I
trust, are sufficient to warrant the opinion that
the Drummer's Letter, in its present shape, was
not written by Sterne.</p>

<h3>OLD FOGIES.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. vii., p. 632.)</p>

<p>At the place above referred to, <span class="sc">Mr. Keightley</span>
puts to me several Queries; but being resident in
the country, I had not an opportunity of seeing
them till the 15th instant, and it took some days
to get the information that would enable me to
answer them.</p>

<p>I have now obtained the most ample evidence
of the existence, in the latter part of the last, and
the beginning of the present, centuries, of the
existence of a peculiar body of men called the
<i>Fogies</i>, in Edinburgh Castle. My informants
agree in describing them as old men, dressed in
red coats with apple-green facings, and cocked
hats. One says that they fired the Castle guns;
another says that he understood them to be the
keepers, or, as we might say, the warders of the
Castle, and that they were sometimes brought into
the town to assist in quelling riots; and this gentleman's
recollection of them goes back to 1784 at
least. But the oldest date I have been able to get
is from a much respected friend, the retired Town
Clerk of Edinburgh, who writes to me thus: "I
have a most vivid recollection of the <i>Castle Foggies</i>.
They were an invalid company, and my recollection
of them goes as far back at least as 1780,
when I was at Stalker's English school in the
Lawnmarket."</p>

<p>To the testimony of these still living witnesses,
I have to add that of Dr. Jamieson, who gives the
word in his <i>Dictionary</i> as one of common and well-known
use in Scotland in his time, 1759-1808;
though he may have mistaken in supposing
it to be exclusively Scottish. It was for his testimony
to this <i>fact</i> that I referred to Dr. Jamieson's
<i>Dictionary</i>, and not for his etymology, for I am
not so much of a "true Scot" as to consider him
infallible in that department. I have not leisure
at present to search any farther for the word in
books, but in the meantime I presume to think
the evidence I have procured of its use in Scotland,
will carry us nearly as far back as <span class="sc">Mr.
Keightley's</span> for its use in Ireland.</p>

<p>I cannot pretend to much acquaintance with
the Swedish language, but I was quite well aware
that that "is what is meant by the mysterious Su.-G."
I was also aware that in the kindred Teutonic
tongues the word runs through the various
forms of <i>vogt</i>, <i>fogat</i>, <i>phogat</i>, <i>voget</i>, <i>voogd</i>, <i>fogde</i>,
<i>foged</i>, <i>fogeti</i>, with the meaning of bailiff, steward,
preses, watchman, guard or protector, tutor, overseer,
judge, mayor, policeman; and I doubt not
that <i>fogie</i> belongs to the same family, though it
has lost its tail. <span class="sc">Mr. Keightley</span> does not need
to be told that words frequently degenerate in
meaning, falling from the noblest to the basest,
from the purest to the most obscene. Is there
then anything improbable in supposing that a word
once applied to the governor or chief keeper of a
castle, came at last to be applied to all, even the
meanest, of his subordinates? Dr. Jamieson asserts
that the word <i>fogde</i> in the Su.-G. has actually
had that fate; can <span class="sc">Mr. Keightley</span> controvert
him?</p>

<p>As a proof, <i>quantum valeat</i>, that the <i>Castle fogies</i>
were so called for some other reason than merely
because of their being "old folks," I may mention
that there was in Edinburgh, for more than
a century, another body of veterans, called the
Town Guard, or City Guard, maintained by the
magistrates as a sort of military police, or gendarmerie,
and finally disbanded in 1817. This
corps was generally recruited from old soldiers;
and during the period of my acquaintance with
them (9½ years) they were all aged, and some of
them very old men; yet I never heard the word
<i>fogies</i> applied to them. On the contrary, they
were always distinguished from the fogies by the
elegant appellation of the "Toon Rottens," or
Town Rats, as well as by their facings, which
were <i>dark blue</i>. Some, indeed, of my younger
friends, who remember the "Rats" very well, say
they never heard of the "Fogies" at all; only
one of them, who lived when a boy at the Castle
Hill, perhaps about forty years ago, recollects of
the word "fogie" as being then applied to the
soldiers of the ordinary veteran or garrison battalions,
with blue facings, that had superseded the
fogies in the keeping of the Castle; but of the
veritable apple-green fogies of the older establishment,
he has no remembrance. As my own recollections
of Edinburgh go back to 1808, the
fogies, I presume, must have been by that time
extinct, for I never saw any of them, though I
frequently heard them spoken of by those who
had seen them.</p>

<p>I may mention also that while "fogie" was in
use, and of well understood application in Scotland,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>{155}</span>
the phrase "old folks," or, to write it according
to our vernacular pronunciation, "auld fo'k,"
was also, and continues to be, in general and familiar
use; but nobody in Scotland, I dare say,
ever imagined that "the auld fo'k" of his ordinary
acquaintance were just "old fogies," or
had anything whatever to do with that peculiar
class of men, properly so called, the keepers of the
royal castles. It is most remarkable, also, that
while the corrupt derivative, as <span class="sc">Mr. Keightley</span>
says "old fogie" is, has been almost quite forgotten
among us, having disappeared with the
men that bore the name of fogies, the parent form,
as he would have "old folks" or "auld fo'k" to
be, should remain in full vigour and common use,
as part of our living speech. In a word, from all
I can learn it would appear that the word "fogie,"
in its most general acceptation, means by itself,
without the "old," an old soldier; and that "old
fogie" is only a tautological form, arising from ignorance
of its meaning. Be its origin, however,
what it may, I have no hesitation now in expressing
my conviction that <span class="sc">Mr. Keightley's</span> etymology
of the word is utterly groundless.</p>

<h3>DESCENDANTS OF JOHN OF GAUNT.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. vii., p. 628.)</p>

<p>All persons will, I think, agree with <span class="sc">Mr. Warden</span>
in his very just complaint of the carelessness
with which many of the English Peerages are compiled.
It would be a task, little short of a new
compilation, to correct the errors and inaccuracies
with which many of these productions abound, the
less pardonable now, because of the facilities
afforded for consulting the Public Records, should
even our older genealogists, without such aids, be
in some degree excused; but as <span class="sc">Mr. Warden</span> invites,
by a personal appeal, the rectification of a
chronological error which has crept into all the
Peerages, founded upon the authority of Dugdale,
respecting the period of the death of Thomas,
sixth Lord Fauconberge, I am induced to send
you a few Notes, which a recent examination of
the Records in the Tower of London has supplied.</p>

<p>When the facts are made patent, there will be
no need to dwell upon the inconsistencies pointed
out by <span class="sc">Mr. Warden</span>, and the alleged incompatibility
in regard to age for an union between two
persons of some note in family history, the son of
the first Earl of Westmoreland and his Countess
Joan and the daughter and heir of the Lord Fauconberge,
who formed an alliance from which the
co-heirs are, it is believed, represented at this
day.</p>

<p>The birth of William Nevill, Lord Fauconberge,
afterwards created Earl of Kent, second
son of a marriage which took place early in, or
just before, the year 1397, may be assigned to in
or about the year 1400; and we shall presently
see that his future wife was born on the 18th of
October, 1406, and married to him before the 1st
of May, 1422.</p>

<p>Walter, fifth Lord Fauconberge, died on the
29th of September, 1362 (Esc. 36 Edw. III., 1st
part, No. 77.), leaving a son Thomas (issue of his
first marriage with Matilda, sister and co-heir of
Sir William de Pateshull, Kt., Esc. 33 Edw. III.,
1st part, No. 40., and <i>Rot. Orig.</i>, 34 Edw. III.,
Ro. 2.), then a minor, under eighteen years of
age.</p>

<p>Thomas, who was born circa 1345, was already
in 1362 married to his first wife Constancia, by
whom he does not appear to have left any issue
surviving. His was rather an eventful life; some
incidents not noticed by Dugdale will be briefly
cited. On the 10th of August, 1372, being then
a knight or chivaler, he had letters of protection
on going abroad in the king's service, in the company
of Thomas de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick
(<i>Rot. Franc.</i>, 46 Edw. III.). Here it seems he
forgot his allegiance, and having gone over to the
French side was branded "tanquam proditor
domini Regis Angliæ" (Esc. 5 Ric. II., No. 67.,
6 Ric. II., No. 180., and 11 Ric. II., No. 59.).
Can this have been the origin of the error in assigning
his death to the year 1376? He was,
however, yet living in 1401, as in that year he
succeeded to the reversion of the estates which his
step-mother Isabella (a sister of Sir John Bygot,
Chivaler), the widow of Walter Lord Fauconberge,
held in dower (Esc. 2 Hen. IV., No. 47.).
Not long after this, and apparently a few years
only before his death, and when somewhat advanced
in years, he married a second time. I
have not been able to ascertain to what family his
wife Joan, or Johanna, belonged, but she survived
her husband only a short time. About the period
of his marriage, too (9th August, 1405), an occurrence
of some importance to his descendants
is recorded, namely, a grant by the king to Sir
Thomas Bromflete and Sir Robert Hilton, of the
custody and governance of all his estates in England,
which had come into the king's hands "ratione
ideociæ Thomæ Fauconberge, Chivaler," to
hold during the life of the said Thomas. This
grant, however, was in the following year, on
24th December, 1406, revoked and annulled, because
the said Thomas had proved before the
king and his council in Chancery, "quod ipse
sanæ discretionis hactenus fuerit et ad tunc existat,"
and he was thereupon re-admitted to his
estates which had descended to him "jure hæreditario
post mortem Walteri Fauconberge patris
sui, cujus hæres ipse est" (<i>Rot. Pat.</i>, p. 1.,
8 Hen. IV., m. 16.). He had only a few months
before (15th February, 1406) obtained from the
king livery of an estate which had come to him in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>{156}</span>
1375 as one of the co-heirs, on his mother's side,
of his grandmother Mabilia, a sister of Otho de
Graunson, upon the death without issue of Thomas
de Graunson, son of the said Otho. (<i>Rot. Pat.</i>,
p. 1., 7 Hen. IV., m. 6.)</p>

<p>Was there in fact any real ground for the suggestion
of Lord Fauconberge's idiocy? This is
one of the gravest imputations that can be cast
upon a family, and it is a most unpardonable presumption
to make it lightly and without justice;
but it is somewhat singular that nearly fifty years
afterwards, his only daughter and heir, born at
the very period when this charge was being refuted,
and when he himself was upwards of sixty
years of age, became the subject of a commission
issued to inquire of her alleged imbecility and
idiocy. The commissioners sat at Gisburn in
Cleveland in the county of York, on the 28th of
March, 1463, and it was then found by the inquest
that "Johanna Fauconberge nuper comitissa
de Kent, fatua et ydeota est, et a nativitate
sua semper fuit, ita quod se terras et tenementa
sua neque alia bona sua regere scit, aut aliquo
tempore scivit:" the jury also returned that she
had not alienated any lands or tenements since
the death of William, late Earl of Kent, her late
husband. That Joan, the wife of Sir Edward
Bethom, Kt., thirty years old and upwards,
Elizabeth, the wife of Richard Strangeways, Esq.,
twenty-eight years old and upwards, and Alice,
wife of John Conyers, Esq., twenty-six years old
and upwards, were the daughters and heirs, as
well of the said William the late earl, as of the
said Joan the late countess. (Esc. 3 Edw. IV.,
No. 33.)</p>

<p>Thomas Lord Fauconberge died on the 9th of
September, 1407, leaving the above-mentioned
Joan, or Johanna, his daughter and heir, an infant
of one year old. (Esc. 9 Hen. IV., No. 19.; see
also Esc. 9 Hen. V., No. 42.) His widow Joan
had assignment of dower after her husband's
death on 20th October, 1408, and she herself died
in the following year, on the 4th of March, 1409.
(Esc. 10 Hen. IV., No. 15.) A later inquisition,
however, taken on 1st of April, 1422 (Esc.
10 Hen. V., No. 22ᵃ.), states that the said Joan,
widow of Sir Thomas Fauconberge, Chivaler, died
on the 23rd of June, 1411. The first date is most
probably the correct one, as a fact would be more
likely to be accurately stated by a jury impanneled
a few months only after the event recorded,
than by an inquest taken after an interval of
twelve or thirteen years.</p>

<p>On the formal proof of age (Esc. 10 Hen. V.,
No. 22ᵇ.) of Joan Fauconberge, daughter and heir
of Thomas Lord Fauconberge and Joan his wife,
taken at Northallerton, in the county of York, on
the 1st of May, 10 Henry V., 1422, she was described
as the wife of William Neville. She
appears to have been born at Skelton in the said
county, and baptized in the church there on the
feast of Saint Luke the Evangelist (18th of October),
1406; and on the same feast in 1421, being
the 9th of Henry V., she had accomplished her
fifteenth year. Dugdale (tom. ii. p. 4.) has fallen
into a singular mistake in alluding to this event,
not to speak of the obvious inconsistency which
those writers who follow his account have introduced
in assigning the year of Lord Fauconberge's
decease to 1372, thus making the daughter's birth
to have occurred more than thirty years after her
father's death. It is this:&mdash;One of the witnesses,
who speaks to the period of the baptism of Joan,
was named <i>Thomas</i> Blawefrount the elder, fifty
years of age and upwards, and the reason assigned
by him for his remembrance of the event
is as follows: "Et hoc scit eo quod Isabella filia
prædicti Thomæ desponsata fuit cuidam Johanni
Wilton, et idem Thomas fuit ad sponsalia eodem
die quo præfata Johanna baptizata fuit, propter
quod bene recolit quod præfata Johanna fuit
ætatis prædictæ." Dugdale has by a strange oversight
made the Isabella here described to be the
daughter of Thomas Fauconberge, and sister of
Joan, instead of the witness' own daughter.</p>

<p>It is not quite evident, from the language of the
document which records the imbecility of the
Countess of Kent in March 1463, whether she
was then actually dead. It appears, however,
clear that she survived her husband, who lived but
a few months to enjoy his newly acquired dignity.</p>

<p>The account given by Dugdale of John, son of
Thomas Lord Fauconberge, is scarcely intelligible.
He says this lord "left issue John, his son and
heir," and subsequently adds, "which John died
without issue in the lifetime of his father."</p>

<p>Lord Fauconberge may have had a son by his
former wife, but I have seen nothing to confirm
this supposition. By an inquisition taken after
the death of Sir Walter Fauconberge, Chivaler, at
Bedford, on the 18th of November, 1415, it was
found that Joan, widow of one Sir John Fauconberge,
Chivaler, deceased, whom Thomas Brounflete,
junior, afterwards married, was then living,
and that she granted to the said Sir Walter all the
estate which she had in certain rents payable by
Matilda Wake, formerly the wife of Sir Thomas
Wake, Chivaler; that the said Sir Walter died
on the 1st of September, 1415, but the jurors
knew not who was his heir. (Esc. 3 Hen. V.,
No. 15.) Dugdale (vol. ii. p. 234.) cites a feoffment
dated 9 Hen. IV., 1407-8, which shows that
Thomas Brounflete, Esq., was then married to the

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

<p><i>Lining of Cameras.</i>&mdash;I find nothing so good to
line a camera with as <i>black velvet</i>; for, black the
inside of a camera as you will, if it is hard wood or
any size used, there will be reflection from the
bottom, which, with very sensitive plates, gives a
dulness which, I think I may say, is caused by
this reflection. I think even the inside of the lens
tube might advantageously be lined with black
velvet.</p>

<p class="author">W. M. F.</p>

<p><i>Cyanuret of Potassium.</i>&mdash;I have been using lately
12 grs. of cyanuret of potassium in 1 oz. of water
for clearing the collodion plates, instead of hypo.
There is one advantage, that there are no crystals
formed if imperfectly washed, which is too common
with hypo. You must take care to well wash off
the developing fluid, whether pyrogallic, protonitrate,
or protosulphite: if you use the latter
40-grains strong, the <i>whitest</i> pictures can be obtained,
nearly as white as after bichloride of
mercury. A good formula to make it is&mdash;</p>

<table class="nob" summary="Formula for developing fluid">
  <tr>
    <td>Distilled water</td>
    <td class="ar">11</td>
    <td>drachms.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Alcohol</td>
    <td class="ar">1</td>
    <td>drachm.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Nitric acid</td>
    <td class="ar">20</td>
    <td>minims.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Protosulphate of iron</td>
    <td class="ar">60</td>
    <td>grains.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>This I know to act well with care, and it will keep
a long time.</p>

<p>I find protonitrate solution&mdash;</p>

<table class="nob" summary="Formula for protonitrate solution">
  <tr>
    <td>Water</td>
    <td class="ar">1½</td>
    <td>ounce.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td class="ar">150</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Protosulph.</td>
    <td class="ar">150</td>
    <td class="ac">"</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>mixed in a proportion of 8 to 4, with a 3-grain
solution of pyrogallic&mdash;a very nice developing
mixture; and, if poured back again after being
used, will suffice 6 or 8 times over; but it is <i>best</i>
new.</p>

<p><i>Minuteness of Detail on Paper.</i>&mdash;Being fond
of antiquarian studies, and having learned from
"N. &amp; Q." the value of photography to the archæologist,
I have serious thoughts of taking up
the practice of the art. Before doing so, however,
I am anxious to learn how far that minuteness of
detail which I so much prize, and which is of such
value to the antiquary, is to be obtained by any of
the processes on paper. I have seen some specimens
produced by collodion which certainly exhibit
that quality in an eminent degree. Is anything
approaching to such minuteness attainable
by any of the Talbotype processes?</p>

<p class="author">F. S. A.</p>

<div class="note">

<p>[Had this Query reached us last week, we should
then, as now, have replied in the affirmative. We
should then have referred, for evidence in support of
our statement, to Mr. Fenton's Well Walk, Cheltenham,
published in the <i>Photographic Album</i>, and to Mr.
Buckle's View of Peterborough. But we may now
adduce a work almost more remarkable for this quality,
namely, a view of Salisbury, by Mr. Russell Sedgefield,
a young wood engraver, which is about to appear in
the forthcoming part of the <i>Photographic Album</i>.</p>

<p>To this beautiful specimen of the art we may certainly
refer as a proof that it is quite possible to obtain
upon paper the greatest nicety of detail; in short,
every minuteness that can be desired, or ought to be
attempted.]</p>

</div>

<p><i>Stereoscopic Angles.</i>&mdash;I think there can be little
doubt that <span class="sc">Mr. T. L. Merritt</span> (Vol. viii., p. 110.)
has solved the problem as to stereoscopic angles:
there can be no reason why one angle should be
used for <i>near</i> objects, and another for <i>distant</i>. A
<i>true</i> representation of nature is required: and, as
we cannot view any object with one of our eyes
eighteen or twenty feet separate from the other,
so it appears to me a true picture cannot be obtained
by taking two views so far apart. The
result must be to <i>dwarf</i> the objects; and, in confirmation
of this, I may state that I was not convinced
that the stereoscopic views were taken
from nature till I understood the cause of their
reduction. All views that I have been able to
purchase, of out-door nature, appear to me to be
taken from models, and not from the objects themselves.</p>

<p>A view of a tower conveys the idea, not of a
tower of stone and lime, but of a very careful
model in cardboard; and this is exactly what
might be expected from taking the views at so
wide an angle. A church is seen, as it would be
seen by a giant whose eyes were twenty feet apart,
or as we would see a small model of it near at
hand.</p>

<p>I hope that some of your photographic correspondents
will settle this question, by taking views
of the same object both by the wide and close
angle, and, by comparing them, ascertain which
conveys to the mind the truest representation of
nature.</p>

<p><i>Sisson's developing Solution</i> (Vol. vii., p. 462.).&mdash;Will
you be so good as to ask <span class="sc">Mr. Sisson</span> if he
finds the above to answer as a bath to plunge the
plate <i>into</i>, instead of pouring on, as in the case of
pyrogallic?</p>

<p>He is entitled to the warm thanks of all photographers
for the discovery of a solution which
produces such pleasing tints with so much ease;
and it needs but the qualification I inquire after
to render it perfect. I have used it when at least
three weeks made, and am not sure that it is not
even better than when fresh.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;Why not devote a little more space to
this fascinating art in "N. &amp; Q."? I think, if
anything, it grows less latterly.</p>

<p><i>Multiplying Photographs.</i>&mdash;In Vol. viii., p. 60.,
you reprint a communication from Sir W. Herschel
which has appeared in <i>The Athenæum</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>{158}</span></p>

<p>It describes a method of printing from glass
negatives, but there being no <i>cut</i> renders the
meaning somewhat obscure.</p>

<p>In the last number of the <i>Photographic Journal</i>
(21st ult.), some mention is made of this letter.
They say it proves to be one already long
in use, Mr. Kilburn having practised it for four
years. I am very desirous of obtaining more
information about it. I want to know the length
of the box or camera required; and also the focus
of the lens, and the best size. Probably Mr. Kilburn
or Sir W. Herschel would one of them be
so kind as to say.</p>

<p class="author">W. M. F.</p>

<p>What kind of lens should be used for taking enlarged
copies of glass negatives according to Mr.
Stewart's plan? and will the same lens also diminish
the picture? Will not the usual camera lens
act?</p>

<p class="author"><span class="sc">Ply.</span></p>

<div class="note">

<p>[The usual compound lens is all that is required.]</p>

</div>

<p>Would you have the goodness to explain, in
some detail, the two methods by which Mr.
Stewart and Mr. Kilburn multiply photographs
in a reduced or magnified size; the one by reflected
light, the other by transmitted. Mr.
Stewart's experiments are upon glass, Mr. Kilburn's
on cameras and daguerreotypes. I have
never seen any description of this latter process,
or of the method of preparing the stereoscope objects:
vide <i>Athenæum</i>, July 30, 1853.</p>

<p>I observe with great pleasure that the cost of
apparatus is becoming less, &amp;c.</p>

<p>[However much we may agree in the views expressed
in the latter part of <span class="sc">An Amateur's</span> letter, we

<p><i>Is it dangerous to use the Ammonio-Nitrate of
Silver?</i> (Vol. viii., p. 134.).&mdash;No: it is now
generally used as the best of <i>marking inks, without
preparation</i>; and we have never yet heard of an
explosion from its use. Mr. Delamotte has evidently
confounded this preparation with the chloride
of silver precipitated with <i>strong ammonia</i>,
which, when dried, forms the article known as
<i>fulminating silver</i>; or by adding to the oxide of
silver lime-water, and afterwards a strong solution
of ammonia, a black powder is thrown down, which,
when dried, is known as <i>Berthollet's fulminating
silver</i>. There is also one other, formed by adding
chloric acid to oxide of silver; after drying this,
and then adding potassa to a solution of it, the
precipitate, by again being dried, becomes an explosive
compound.</p>

<p>The photographer forms a weak solution for his
purpose with one of the least soluble and <i>weakest</i>
of the ammoniacal preparations, and which, by
drying <i>around the stopper of the bottle</i>, is very unlikely
to become explosive, from its wanting the
addition of another element as necessary to the
formation of an explosive compound. For my
own part, I must say, that I have found, from experience,
all the compound solutions of silver keep
much better, and the photogenic effect more
satisfactory, by mixing only so much as I may
require for immediate use, at this time of the year
especially.</p>

<p><i>Odour from the Rainbow</i> (Vol. iii. pp. 224. 310.).&mdash;This
idea has been traced to Bacon's <i>Sylva</i>,
Browne's <i>Britannia's Pastorals</i>, Snow's <i>Miscellaneous
Poems</i>, and to a Greek writer referred to by
Coleridge. Georgius de Rhodes, in his <i>Peripatetic
Philosophy</i>, mentions the same effect of the rainbow,
and quotes Pliny:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Dico sexto, iridis effectus duos præcipue numerari.
Primus est, quod plantas, arbores, frutices, quibus incubuerit,
efficit odorationes. Tradunt, inquit Plinius
lib. xii. c. 24., in quocunque frutice incurvetur cœlestis

<p><i>Judges styled Reverend</i> (Vol. iv., pp. 151. 198).&mdash;The
following is an extract from the title of a
small octavo volume, printed for the assignees of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>{159}</span>
John More, Esq., London, 1635, which lately came
into my hands:&mdash;<i>La novel Natura Brevium du Juge
Tresreverend Monsieur Anthony Fitzherbert</i>; with
a new table by William Rastall. The preface is
headed as follows:&mdash;"La Preface sur cest lieuz
compose per le Reverend Justice Anthony Fitzherbert."</p>

<p>Anthony Fitzherbert was appointed Chief Justice
of the Common Pleas in 1523, and died in
30 Hen. VIII. William Rastall was appointed
Serjeant-at-law in 1554, and one of the Justices
of the Common Pleas in 1558: it would seem,
therefore, that as Rastall is not styled "Serjeant-at-law"
in the title-page of the book when he
made a new table to its contents, that the complimentary
style of Reverend, as applicable to the
judges, was used at least as late as the middle of
the sixteenth century.</p>

<p><i>Jacob Bobart</i> (Vol. viii., p. 37.).&mdash;I beg to
supply the following additional particulars relating
to the Bobart family. In the <i>Correspondence of
Dr. Richardson</i>, edited by Mr. Dawson Turner,
will be found a letter from Bobart junior to the
Doctor, with a reference to two other letters. In
pages 9, 10, and 11, a copious note respecting the
Bobart family, by the editor, is given. A short
notice of Bobart jun. also appears in the Memoirs
of John Martyn, Professor of Botany at
Cambridge. The following epitaph on Bobart
jun. is in Amherst's <i>Terræ Filius</i>, 1726:</p>

<p><i>The Tragedy of Polidus</i> (Vol. vii., p. 499.).&mdash;This
tragedy, printed at London 1723, 12mo., has
a farce appended to it called <i>All Bedevil'd, or the
House in a Hurry</i>. Browne was patronised by
Hervey, the author of the <i>Meditations</i>. The scene
of the drama is in Cyprus. The lover of Polidus,
"the banished general," and Rosetta, daughter to
Orlont, chief favourite to the king, form the
groundwork of the plot. My copy was formerly
in the collection of plays which belonged to Stephen

<p><i>Robert Fairlie</i> (Vol. vii., p. 581.).&mdash;In answer
to the Query as to Robert Fairley, or more properly
Fairlie, I may mention that there is in my
possession a presentation by the Faculty of Advocates,
dated July 27, 1622, to "Robert Fairlie,
son lawfull to Umquhill Robert Fairlie, goldsmith,
Burgh of Edinburgh, to the said bursar place and
haill immunities quhill he pass his course of Philosophie,"
in the College of Edinburgh. This undoubtedly
was the author of the two very rare little
poetical volumes referred to; and it proves, from
the use of the word "Umquhill," that his father
was then dead.</p>

<p>There is an error in stating that the <i>Kalendarium</i>
is dedicated to the Earl of Ancrum. In the copy
before me it is inscribed "Illustrissimo et Nobilissimo
Domino, Domino Roberto Karo Comiti a Summerset,"
&amp;c. The other work is the one dedicated
to Lord Ancrum. I have both works, and they certainly
were costly, as I gave five guineas for them.
They had originally been priced at ten guineas.</p>

<p>A <i>Bursary</i>, according to Jamieson, is "the endowment
given to a student in a university, an
exhibition." It is believed that Fairlie was of the
Ayrshire family of that name.</p>

<span class="sc">Anon</span> and <span class="sc">Tye</span>. But, remarkable as were
the instances mentioned by them of the two old
ladies in Cheshire and Limington, who could speak
to their descendants in a female line to the fifth
generation, still that I am now to record of an old
man in Montenegro is much more singular, as he
could converse with his lineal descendants in an
uninterrupted <i>male</i> line one generation farther
from him, (i. e.) to the sixth. The case is too well
authenticated to admit of a doubt, and until some
one of your correspondents shall favour me with
another equally to be credited, it will remain in
the columns of "N. &amp; Q." as the only one known
to its readers:&mdash;</p>

which reckoned six generations. The venerable head
of the family was 117 years old, his son 100, his grandson

<p><i>Murder of Monaldeschi</i> (Vol. viii., p. 34.).&mdash;The
following account of this event is taken from
the <i>Biographie Universelle</i>, article "Christine, reine
de Suède:"</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Cet Italien avait joui de toute la confiance de la
reine, qui lui avait révélé ses pensées les plus secrètes.
Arrivée à Fontainebleau, elle l'accusa de trahison, et
résolut de le faire mourir. Un religieux de l'ordre de
la Trinité, le P. Lebel, fut appelé pour le préparer à la
mort. Monaldeschi se jeta aux pieds de la reine et
fondit en larmes. Le religieux, qui a publié lui-même
un récit de l'événement, fit à Christine les plus fortes
représentations sur cet acte de vengeance qu'elle voulait
exercer arbitrairement dans une terre étrangère et dans
le palais d'un grand souverain; mais elle resta inflexible,
et ordonna à Sentinelli, capitaine de ses gardes, de
faire exécuter l'arrêt qu'elle avait prononcé. Monaldeschi,
soupçonnant le danger qu'il courait, s'était cuirassé:
il fallut le frapper de plusieurs coups avant qu'il
expirât, et la galerie des Cerfs, où se passa cette scène
révoltante, fut teinte de son sang. Pendant ce temps,
Christine, au rapport de plusieurs historiens, était dans
une pièce attenante, s'entretenant avec beaucoup de
calme de choses indifférentes; selon d'autres rapports,
elle fut présente à l'exécution, accabla Monaldeschi de
reproches amers, et contempla ensuite son cadavre sanglant
avec une satisfaction qu'elle ne chercha point à
dissimuler. Que ces détails soient fondés ou non, la
mort de Monaldeschi est une tache ineffaçable à la mémoire
de Christine, et c'est à regret qu'on voit sur la
liste de ses apologistes le nom du fameux Leibnitz."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In the answer which Queen Christina sent to
the objections made in Poland to her election as
their sovereign, occurs the following passage:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Le Père dira en témoignage de la vérité, que cet
homme me força de le faire mourir par la trahison la
plus noire qu'un serviteur puisse faire à son maître;
que je n'ordonnai sa mort, qu'après l'avoir convaincu
de son crime par les lettres en original écrites de sa
propre main, et après de lui avoir fait avouer à lui-même,
en présence de trois témoins, et du Père prieur
de Fontainebleau: qu'ils savent qu'il dit lui-même:
'Je suis digne de mille morts,' et que je lui fis donner
les sacremens dont il était capable avant que de le faire
mourir."&mdash;<i>Mémoires concernant Christine</i>, Amst. et
Leipzig, 1759, tom. iii. pp. 386-7.</p>

<p><i>Land of Green Ginger</i> (Vol. viii., p. 34.).&mdash;It

use of the word "unneath," used in Parnell's
<i>Fairy Tale</i>, have fallen into a slight mistake in
supposing that the seemingly old words used in
this poem are really so. I make no doubt that
<span class="sc">Mr. Halliwell</span> is correct in noting the word
"unneath" as signifying "beneath," in the <i>patois</i>
of Somerset; but I gravely suspect that Parnell
had picked up the word out of our older poets,
and used it in the passage quoted without consideration.</p>

<p>The true meaning of "unneath" (which is of
Saxon origin, and variously written "unnethe,
unnethes") is <i>scarcely</i>, <i>not easily</i>.</p>

<p>"Unneath," signifying <i>difficult</i>, <i>scarcely</i>, <i>with
difficulty</i>, occurs so frequently in Spenser, that it
is unnecessary to burden your pages with references.
It may be remarked, however, that this
latter author occasionally employs this word in the
sense of <i>almost</i>.</p>

<p><i>Snail Gardens</i> (Vol. viii., p. 33.).&mdash;In very
many places on the Continent snails are regularly
bred for the table: this is the case at Ulm, Wirtemberg,
and various other places. A very lively
description of the sale of snails in the Roman
market is given by Sir Francis Head. I have
collected much interesting information on this
point, and shall feel grateful for any farther
"Notes" on the subject.</p>

<p><i>Parvise</i> (Vol. vii., p. 624.).&mdash;Perhaps the following
quotation may throw light on your correspondent
D. P.'s inquiry respecting this word,
in French <i>Parvis</i>. It is taken from a <i>Dictionnaire
Universel, contenant généralement tous les mots
françois, tant vieux que modernes, &amp;c., par feu
Messire Antoine Furetière, Abbé de Chalivoi</i>,
three vols. folio, La Haye et la Rotterdam, 1701:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="sc">Parvis</span>, <i>s. m.</i>&mdash;Place publique qui est ordinairement
devant la principale face des grandes Eglises.
Le parvis de Nôtre Dame, de Saint Généviève. On
le disoit autrefois de toutes les places qui étoient devant
les palais, et grandes maisons. Les auteurs
Chrétiens appellent le <i>Parvis des Gentiles</i>, ce que les
Juifs appelloient le <i>premier Temple</i>. Il y avoit deux
<i>Parvis</i> dans le Temple de Jérusalem; l'un intérieur,
qui étoit celui des Prêtres; et l'autre extérieur, qu'on
appelloit aussi le <i>Parvis d'Israël</i>, ou le <i>Grand Parvis</i>.&mdash;<span class="sc">Le Cl.</span></p>

<p>"Quelques-uns disent que ce mot vient de <i>Paradisus</i>;
d'autres de <i>parvisium</i>, qui est un lieu au bas de la nef
où l'on tenoit autrefois les petites Ecoles, <i>à docendo
parvis pueris</i>. Voyez Menage, qui rapporte plusieurs
titres curieux en faveur de l'une et de l'autre opinion.
D'autres le dérivent de <i>pervius</i>, disant qu'on appelloit
autrefois <i>pervis</i>, une place publique devant un batiment."</p>

<p><i>Humbug</i> (Vol. vii., p. 631.).&mdash;Allow me to add
the following to the list of explanations as to the
origin of this word. There appeared in the <i>Berwick
Advertiser</i> the following origin of the word <i>humbug</i>,
and it assuredly is a very feasible one. It
may be proper to premise, that the name of <i>bogue</i>
is commonly pronounced <i>bug</i> in that district of
Scotland formerly called the "Mearns."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is not generally known that this word, presently
so much in vogue, is of Scottish origin. There was in
olden time a race called Bogue, or Boag of that ilk, in
Berwickshire. A daughter of the family married a
son of Hume of Hume. In process of time, by default
of male issue, the Bogue estate devolved on one Geordie
Hume, who was called popularly 'Hume o' the
Bogue,' or rather 'Aum o' the Bug.' This worthy
was inclined to the marvellous, and had a vast inclination
to exalt himself, his wife, family, brother, and
all his ancestors on both sides. His tales however did
not pass current; and at last, when any one made an
extraordinary statement in the Mearns, the hearer
would shrug up his shoulders, and style it just 'a hum
o' the bug.' This was shortened into <i>hum-bug</i>, and the
word soon spread like wildfire over the whole kingdom."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>How far this is, or is not true, cannot be known;
but it is certain that the Lands of Bogue, commonly
called by country folk "Bug," passed by
marriage into the Hume family; and that the male
representatives of this ancient family are still in
existence. This much may be fairly asserted,
that the Berwickshire legend has more apparent
probability about it than any of the other ones.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="sc">J. Mt.</span></p>

<p>P. S.&mdash;"That ilk," in old Scotch, means "the
same:" in other words, Hume of that ilk is just
Hume of Hume; and Brodie of that ilk, Brodie
of Brodie.</p>

<p><i>Table-moving</i> (Vol. vii., p. 596.).&mdash;I imagine
that the great object in <i>table-moving</i> is to produce
the desired effect <i>without</i> pressure. During experiments
I have often heard the would-be "table-movers"
cry "Don't press: it must be done
without any pressure."</p>

<p><i>Scotch Newspapers</i> (Vol. viii., p. 57.).&mdash;In Ruddiman's
<i>Life</i>, by G. Chalmers (8vo. Lond. 1794),
it is stated that Cromwell was the first who communicated
the benefit of a newspaper to Scotland.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>{162}</span>
In 1652, Christopher Higgins, a printer, whom
Cromwell had conveyed with his army to Leith,
reprinted there what had been already published
at London, <i>A Diurnal of some passages and affairs
for the information of the English Soldiers</i>. A
newspaper of Scottish manufacture appeared at
Edinburgh, the same authority relates, on the 31st
of December, 1660, under the title of <i>Mercurius
Caledonius</i>; comprising the affairs in agitation in
Scotland, with a survey of foreign intelligence.
It was published once a week, in a small 4to. form
of eight pages. Chalmers adds, that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It was a son of the Bishop of Orkney, Thomas
Lydserfe, who now thought he had the wit to amuse,
the knowledge to instruct, and the address to captivate
the lovers of news in Scotland. But he was only able,
with all his powers, to extend his publication to ten
numbers, which were very loyal, very illiterate, and
very affected."</p>

<p><i>Door-head Inscriptions</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 23. 190.
588.; Vol. viii., p. 38.).&mdash;Over the door of the
house at Salvington, Sussex, in which Selden was
born, is this inscription:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"Gratvs, honeste, mihi; non clavdar, inito sedeq'</p>
    <p class="i1">Fvr, abeas; non sv' facta solvta tibi."</p>

</div>

<p>It has been thus paraphrased:</p>

<p>1. By the late William Hamper, Esq., <i>Gent.
Mag.</i>, 1824, vol. ii. p. 601.:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"Thou'rt welcome, honest friend; walk in, make free:</p>
    <p>Thief, get thee gone; my doors are clos'd to thee."</p>

<p>2. By Dr. Evans:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"An honest man is always welcome here;</p>
    <p>To rogues I grant no hospitable cheer."</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>3. In Evans's <i>Picture of Worthing</i>, p. 129.:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"Dear to my heart, the honest here shall find</p>
    <p>The gate wide open, and the welcome kind;</p>
    <p>Hence, <i>thieves</i>, away! on you my door shall close,</p>
    <p>Within these walls the wicked ne'er repose."</p>

    <p>"The honest man shall find a welcome here,</p>

<p><i>Honorary Degrees</i> (Vol. viii., pp. 8. 86.).&mdash;The
short note of C. does not elucidate&mdash;if, indeed, it
touches upon&mdash;the matter propounded. It was
stated, whether correctly I know not, that honorary
doctors created by <i>diploma</i> (reference being
made to the Duke of Cambridge, and one or two
other royal personages) would have the <i>distinctive</i>
privilege of voting in Convocation. It then occurred
to me that Johnson&mdash;whose Oxford dignity
was conferred in 1776, by special requisition of
the Chancellor, Lord North (his M.A. degree had
been, I judge, likewise by <i>diploma</i>)&mdash;is not mentioned
by Boswell or Croker, as having on any
occasion exercised the right referred to. Did he
possess that right? and, if so, was it ever exercised?
The frequency of his visits to Oxford, and
the alleged rigid adherence to academical costume,
make the question one of some interest: besides,
in regard to a person so entirely <i>sui generis</i>, and
upon whose character and career so much minuteness
of biographical detail has been bestowed, it is
not a little remarkable how many points are almost
barren of illustration.</p>

<p class="right">"Bonn, July 19. 1852.</p>

<p>"This light and pleasant Farina is one of the
most excellent, nourishing, and restorative
remedies, and supersedes, in many cases, all
kinds of medicines. It is particularly useful
in confined habit of body, as also diarrhœa,
bowel complaints, affections of the kidneys and
bladder, such as stone or gravel; inflammatory
irritation and cramp of the urethra, cramp of
the kidneys and bladder, strictures, and hemorrhoids.
This really invaluable remedy is employed
with the most satisfactory result, not
only in bronchial and pulmonary complaints,
where irritation and pain are to be removed,
but also in pulmonary and bronchial consumption,
in which it counteracts effectually the
troublesome cough; and I am enabled with
perfect truth to express the conviction that Du
Barry's Revalenta Arabica is adapted to the
cure of incipient hectic complaints and consumption.</p>

<p>SOME ACCOUNT of DOMESTIC
ARCHITECTURE in ENGLAND,
from the Conquest to the end of the Thirteenth
Century, with numerous Illustrations of Existing
Remains from Original Drawings. By
T. HUDSON TURNER.</p>

<p>"What Horace Walpole attempted, and what
Sir Charles Lock Eastlake has done for oil-painting&mdash;elucidated
its history and traced its
progress in England by means of the records
of expenses and mandates of the successive
Sovereigns of the realm&mdash;Mr. Hudson Turner
has now achieved for Domestic Architecture in
this country during the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries."&mdash;<i>Architect.</i></p>

<p>"The writer of the present volume ranks
among the most intelligent of the craft, and
a careful perusal of its contents will convince
the reader of the enormous amount of labour
bestowed on its minutest details, as well as the
discriminating judgment presiding over the
general arrangement."&mdash;<i>Morning Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>"The book of which the title is given above
is one of the very few attempts that have been
made in this country to treat this interesting
subject in anything more than a superficial
manner.</p>

<p>"Mr. Turner exhibits much learning and
research, and he has consequently laid before
the reader much interesting information. It
is a book that was wanted, and that affords us
some relief from the mass of works on Ecclesiastical
Architecture with which of late years
we have been deluged.</p>

<p>"The work is well illustrated throughout
with wood-engravings of the more interesting
remains, and will prove a valuable addition to
the antiquary's library."&mdash;<i>Literary Gazette.</i></p>

<p>"It is as a text-book on the social comforts
and condition of the Squires and Gentry of
England during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries,
that the leading value of Mr. Turner's
present publication will be found to consist.</p>

<p>"Turner's handsomely-printed volume is
profusely illustrated with careful woodcuts of
all important existing remains, made from
drawings by Mr. Blore and Mr. Twopeny."&mdash;<i>Athenæum.</i></p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,

other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no

Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
